# Trade_Performance_Tracker
tracks the perfomance of a trader according to his trades
just by a click of a button it collects your history from mt5 and creates an equity curve showing your progress
for mt4 you can pass a htm file 
also you can filter trades according to the symbol if you want to view your progress in a certain symbol
very soon it will have a traing journal and a drawdown tracker . the journal will allow for screen shots in order to veiw the trade you took 
NOTE: MT5  dose not run on linux just windows so this web app only works on windows
